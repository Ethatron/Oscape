The current version of SCAPE is 1.2.

Changes since version 1.1:

	- Support ABN metric for data-dependent triangulation.  This
	  is primarily for comparison purposes.  It can be a useful
	  heuristic for smooth surfaces, but it does not perform
	  particularly well on terrain surfaces.

	- Fixed division-by-zero bug in data-independent triangle scan
	  conversion.  This didn't actually cause erroneous results;
	  the result of the division by zero was never used.  However,
	  some systems halt with a floating point exception when it
	  occurs.

Changes since version 1.0:

	- The EPS generated for mesh diagrams was very minimal and did
	  not have the proper structured comments.  It should now be
	  more compliant.

	- The Delaunay triangulator had a bug in the InsertSite
	  routine which could cause exceedingly bizarre things to
	  happen when near the boundaries.  Due to the regular
	  organization of points, this did not alter the resulting
	  mesh.  However, it did cause excessive useless computation.
	  Note that this could result in incorrect behavior with
	  arbitrary data sites.  If you used this code in your own
	  programs, use this new fix.  See the file quadedge.C for
	  details.

	- SCAPE was being rather inconsistent about its choice of
	  coordinate axes.  The STM files should position (0,0) in the
	  NW corner.  The terrains were being displayed in world
	  coordinates with (0,0) in the SW corner.  This was resulting
	  in "upside down" terrains.  Consistency has certainly been
	  improved, but there may be some lingering inconsistencies
	  lurking around.  Be careful!

	- More conversion utilities are provided for using USGS DEMs.
	  See the directory STM-tools/DEMutil.

	- The TIN output format is not exactly a widely used standard.
	  The program TIN-tools/tin2obj is a very simple-minded
	  converter to create Wavefront .OBJ files from TIN files.
